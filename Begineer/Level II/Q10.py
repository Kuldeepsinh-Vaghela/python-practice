# We are making n stone piles! The first pile has n stones. If n is
# even, then all piles have an even number of stones. If n is odd, all
# piles have an odd number of stones. Each pile must have more
# stones than the previous pile but as few as possible. Write a
# Python program to find the number of stones in each pile.
# Sample Input: n = 7
# Sample Output: Stones in a single pile = [2, 4, 6]


def stone_piles(n):
    piles = []
    for x in range(n):
        value = n + (2 * x)
        piles.append(value)

    return piles
